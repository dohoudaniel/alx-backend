#### Caching (Python)

In this directory, I learn about Caching in Python, using caching algorithms, and caching replacement policies.

The concepts I learned in this directory are:
- Caching
- Uses of Caching
- Cache Replacement Algorithms:
    - `FIFO` (First In First Out)
    - `LIFO` (Last In First Out)
    - `LRU` (Least Recently Used)
    - `MRU` (Most Recently Used)
    - `LFU` (Least Frequently Used)
