#### Pagination

In this directory, I learn about pagination, and solve tasks on how to implement it.

Some of the concepts I learned are:
- Meaning of Pagination
- How to implement pagination
- Implementing pagination using:
    - A dataset
    - An existing database
    - A Flask REST API
    - HATEOAS (Hypertext As The Engine Of Application State)
- Using datasets


ChatGPT helped too in learning these concepts
